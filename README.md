ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION

No need to run any of the supporting methids(getCitizens and getDistances) if the files pops.npy and popsPerDist.npy exists.

run the rotas.py, select the number of iterations, the number of ants, the initial city and the evaporation rate to start the simulation, wait for the result at the end.
